## 📝 Description
A graphical implementation of the classic Italian card game "Sette e Mezzo" (Seven and a Half), developed in C++ as part of a high school programming challenge. This project was created during my second year of high school as an optional assignment, achieving the highest grade through its implementation of both game logic and graphical interface.
## ⭐ Features

- Graphical user interface for card display
- Player vs CPU gameplay
- Intelligent CPU opponent with strategic decision making
- Traditional Italian card deck visualization
- Real-time score tracking
- Interactive yes/no decision system
- Visual card animations and effects

## 🎮 Game Rules

- The objective is to get as close to 7.5 points as possible without going over
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 0.5 points
- Number cards (1-7) are worth their face value
- Players can choose to draw additional cards ("hit") or stop ("stand")
- The CPU opponent makes strategic decisions based on probability
- Going over 7.5 results in an automatic loss
- The player closest to 7.5 without going over wins

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

- C++ compiler with GUI library support
- Graphics library: [Specify the library you used]
- Minimum screen resolution: 800x600
- Operating System: Windows/Linux/MacOS

## 🚀 Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sette-e-mezzo.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd sette-e-mezzo
```
Compile the source code:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o sette_e_mezzo 
```
## 💡 Project Background
This project was developed alongside a command-line slot machine game during my second year of high school programming class. While both projects demonstrated programming fundamentals, this one focused on:

- GUI development and event handling
- Advanced game logic implementation
- AI decision-making algorithms
- Probability calculations for CPU player
- Visual asset management
- User interaction design

## 🎯 CPU Strategy
The computer opponent implements a sophisticated decision-making algorithm that:

- Calculates probability of beneficial draws
- Considers the player's visible cards
- Adjusts risk tolerance based on game state
- Uses basic card counting principles
- Makes human-like decisions to enhance gameplay
